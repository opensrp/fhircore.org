## OpenSRP FHIR Core Smart Vaccination Certificates

OpenSRP FHIR Core is an open source [HL7 FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) Native Android application designed to meet WHO's Smart Vaccine certificate guidelines. This application is designed to be quickly adaptable by countries to support a Covid-19 vaccine rollout.  Using the app, you can uniquely identify and register clients, record Covid-19 vaccinations and then issue a Smart Vaccine Certificate based on WHO guidelines.
